# edt-pin.sh — pin guard for the 1C:EDT base the CI e2e / conformance gate validates against.
#
# WHY. The public 1C:EDT p2 channel  https://edt.1c.ru/downloads/releases/ruby/<channel>/
# is a SIMPLE p2 repository that is MUTATED IN PLACE on every point-release — there is NO
# immutable per-release URL to pin to. So the EDT-base GitHub cache, keyed only by the channel
# URL, silently goes stale: an OLD cached base gets overlaid with the NEWLY-served EDT bundles,
# and the p2 director then cannot pick a consistent servlet-api / jetty wiring for
# dt.html -> activedocument.ui (a felix uses-constraint conflict) — the systemic, intermittent
# e2e / conformance failure.
#
# WHAT. We PIN the EDT build qualifier each channel is expected to serve, DETECT what the
# channel actually serves right now (the com._1c.g5.v8.dt.core version inside content.xml.xz),
# and FAIL LOUDLY when 1C ships a newer build — forcing a conscious re-pin. The detected
# qualifier is echoed on stdout for the cache key, so the base cache tracks the served build
# and can never be stale (a new build => a new key => a fresh, self-consistent base).
#
# USAGE.  edt-pin.sh <channel> <edt-p2-url>
#   <channel>     the ruby/<channel>/ segment, e.g. 2025.2 / 2026.1
#   <edt-p2-url>  the full p2 URL (trailing slash), e.g. https://.../ruby/2026.1/
# Prints ONE line on stdout: the build qualifier to fold into the cache key. All human /
# annotation output goes to stderr. Exit 1 on a confirmed drift or an unknown channel.
#
# TO RE-PIN after 1C ships a new build: bump the qualifier in the PIN MAP below to the value
# the failure message reports, then re-run — the base cache refreshes automatically.
