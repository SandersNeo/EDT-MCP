Builds (compiles to disk) the external data processors/reports of an EDT **external-object project** to `.epf`/`.erf` files - the headless equivalent of EDT's "save external data processor/report to file" action. Build one named object or all of them in a single call.

## When to use
- You authored an external data processor/report in an EDT external-object project (created with `create_project projectKind=externalObjects`) and need the deliverable `.epf`/`.erf` file(s) on disk.
- Producing artifacts for a build pipeline, for loading into a running 1C client, or for distribution.

## Preconditions (hard, variant A)
The platform compiles the object against an **associated infobase + a resolvable 1C runtime**, exactly like `update_database`. If that is missing the build cannot run:
- A registered 1C runtime must be installed/resolvable in EDT (otherwise the tool returns a graceful "dumper is not available" error).
- If the associated infobase requires user authentication, set the connection credentials first:
  - `create_infobase` to create/associate an infobase, and
  - `set_infobase_credentials` (user/password) so the unattended build can authenticate.
- The project must be open and finished building (a transient "Project is building" is refused with a retry hint).

## Parameter details
- `projectName` (required) - the EDT external-object project to build. Must be a `projectKind=externalObjects` project.
- `objectName` (optional) - the name of a single external data processor/report to build. **Omit to build ALL** external objects of the project.
- `outputDir` (required) - filesystem directory the `.epf`/`.erf` files are written to. Relative paths are resolved to absolute; the directory is created if missing. If the path exists but is a file, the call errors. A directory outside the EDT workspace is allowed but flagged (`outsideWorkspace: true`) - the server is trusted-caller-only.
- `recordBuildTime` (optional, default `true`) - when `true`, the build time is written into each built object's `Comment` (`Время сборки: <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>`) and flushed to the `.mdo`, so the object records when it was last built. Set `false` to build **without mutating the object** (no `Comment` change, no `.mdo` diff). The build time is reported in the response `message` either way.

## What you get
A JSON result:
- `success` - `true` only when **every** requested object built; `false` (with `isError`) when any object failed.
- `project`, `outputDir` (absolute), `built`, `failed`.
- `results` - one entry per object: `{name, success, path, durationMs}` on success or `{name, success:false, error, durationMs}` on failure (a build of all objects continues past one bad object). `durationMs` is that object's build time in milliseconds.
- `outsideWorkspace` - present and `true` when `outputDir` is outside the workspace.
- `message` (on a successful build) reports the total build time and a `built at` timestamp, so you can tell which build is the latest.

## Notes & gotchas
- **Build ALL of an empty project** (no external objects yet, `objectName` omitted) is a clear **success** with `built: 0`, `failed: 0` and a "nothing to build" message - not an error. Note the prerequisites are checked first: the 1C build service and the infobase/runtime precondition are validated before enumeration, so a project with no associated infobase returns the precondition error rather than the empty "nothing to build" success. Requesting a specific `objectName` that the project does not have IS a value-naming "not found" error.
- **Unattended-safe:** the compile/dump runs in a background job off the JSON-RPC thread, with a bounded timeout; the "Configure Infobase access Settings" and "Application update"/"Restructure data" modals are auto-handled so the call never blocks.
- A build failure that looks like a connection/authentication problem is annotated with a hint pointing at `create_infobase` / `set_infobase_credentials`.
- **Stale output is deleted before each build:** the target `.epf`/`.erf` is removed before the object is dumped, because EDT can cache the compiled artifact and leave an old version in place; deleting it first forces a clean, current build. If the file cannot be deleted, that object is reported as a failure rather than silently shipping a stale file.
- **Each object's Comment is stamped with the build time (by default, opt-out):** when `recordBuildTime` is `true` (the default), before dumping, the object's Comment property is overwritten with a build-time stamp (`Время сборки: <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>`) — one timestamp per build run, shared by all objects — and persisted to its `.mdo` on disk, so both the source and the built `.epf`/`.erf` record when it was built. This **mutates the object's source on every build**; pass `recordBuildTime: false` to build without touching the object (the build time is still reported in the response `message`).
- This **writes to the filesystem at the path you give** - double-check `outputDir`.

## Maintainer note
After adding/changing this tool, the `tools/list` golden snapshot (`tools_list.golden.json`) MUST be regenerated against the live server on the EDT stand - it cannot be hand-edited.
